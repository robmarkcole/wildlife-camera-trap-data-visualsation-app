# wildlife-camera-trap-data-visualsation-app
Visualise wildlife camera trap data

Wildlife camera trap data consists of geolocated time stamped images in folders. This app enables processing of images to identify animal species in images, logging of the time and location of the animals, and visualisation of the logged data on a map with time scrubbing. 

## Project goals
* Develop easy to use app for visualising camera trap data, processing via open source/free models & APIs
* Investigate ways to engage [citizen scientists](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13099) to assist with labelling datasets in order to create new models for species detection
* Integrate with live & low cost 'wildlife protection' (anti-poacher) systems
